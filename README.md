Markup :   
            I used javascript(Vanilla JS) to manipulate the DOM
            I created a card container which holds all the cards and allow them to be shuffled when the game is refreshed.
            I created a Move counter and a Timer, the counter starts when a pair of card
            I created a star that indicate number of move to compensate the player based on the number of moves
