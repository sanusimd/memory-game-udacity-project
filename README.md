## How i Build the Memory Game
        1. I used javascript(Vanilla JS) to manipulate the DOM
        2. I created a card container which holds all the cards and allow them to be shuffled when the game is refreshed.
        3. I created a Move counter and a Timer, the counter starts when a pair of card
        4. I created a star that indicate number of move to compensate the player based on the number of moves 
        5. I create a pop-up  Modal for message when the player wins the game.
